# More Tools++

## About

Yet another mod that adds tools, but this time with a twist ;).
This mod features powerful tools, which are easy to craft.
Every added tool has its own consequences when you use it to balance them.

## Content

- Magma Tools
    - Destroys broken blocks
    - Instantly breaks blocks
    - Puts hit entities on fire
    - Puts user on fire whenever used in any way
    - Low durability
- Lapis Tools
    - Multiplies block drops with current experience level of the player
    - Extremely low durability
    -
    - The higher the multiplication, the higher the chance that the player will accidentally open a rift to an alternate
      dimension where experience originates from. Also, the strength of the creatures that pour out of this rift is also
      related to the level of multiplication, so is their number
- **_More tools will be added in future updates_**
